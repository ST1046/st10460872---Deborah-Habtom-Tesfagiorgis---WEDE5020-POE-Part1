    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        Paws is a dedicated Non-Profit Organization committed to the welfare and rehabilitation of stray and abandoned
        animals across South Africa.
        We provide a sanctuary for cats, dogs, puppies, kittens, and smaller critters like bunnies, hamsters, and guinea
        pigs.
        Our mission is to offer a safe, loving environment where every animal receives the care they need to recover and
        thrive.
        Given the high number of stray animals in South Africa, many of which face dangers on the streets, Paws steps in
        as a beacon of hope.
        Through our free neutering and spaying services, we aim to control the stray animal population, ultimately
        contributing to safer roads and healthier communities.
        Our website connects the public with our cause, showcasing the animals in our care and offering ways to support
        through donations, fostering, or adoption.
        Each contribution helps create a safer, more compassionate world for these vulnerable creatures
