    <h2>Exciting News</h2>
    <p>We are thrilled to announce that Paws has received a ground-breaking donation of R1 million from a generous
        anonymous benefactor!<br> This incredible contribution will allow us to expand our facilities, creating
        additional
        space for more animals in need.<br>

        With this donation, Paws plans to build a new state-of-the-art rehabilitation centre, complete with advanced
        medical equipment<br> and dedicated spaces for both small critters and larger animals. This expansion will
        significantly increase our capacity to rescue and care for stray <br> and abandoned animals, ensuring they
        receive the love and attention they deserve.

        Stay tuned for more updates as we begin <br> construction on this exciting new chapter for Paws. We are
        immensely
        grateful for the support of our community and cannot wait to share the progress with you all!
